            <p>This project is a sleep timer and reminder for incentivising sleep. The user will prompt Alexa that they're going to bed,
                and will then be asked to know when they they're going to bed, and when they plan to wake up. Once those things are done, the 
                user can rest assure knowing that Alexa will remind them when its time to wake up.</p>
            <p>
                Once the time for waking up comes, Alexa will ask if they want to snooze or not. She will then do so based on the user's response.
                Once the user wants to wake up, Alexa will let the user know about how long they slept, including snooze time. 
                The user gets points from sleeping consistantly, and can loose points based on times snoozed, or irragualr sleep times. 
                The user is able to opt out of the game at any time, and can be used only as a sleep timer if the user so chooses.
            </p>

                This project is related to the book that we read in class called "Addiction by Design" by Natasha Dow Sch√ºll. It talks 
                about how technology is designed to be addictive, and how it can be used to help people. This project is designed to help 
                users get better sleep by 'game-ifying' the process.
