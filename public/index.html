                    <i>'Jump Monke Jump!'</i> is an AR party game made in Unity, where two players take turns going from
                    one side of the course to the other, but with a twist. After every successful round for both
                    players, each player gets to place an obstacle into the play-space. This allows for each gameplay
                    experience to be different from the last.

                    My role on this project was with coding and art. I helped code some of the mechanics in the game for
                    obstacles, and I did the art for all project assets. The theme that our team chose for this project
                    were simple cartoon characters and objects. When designing this game, we took a lot of inspiration
                    from party games such as <i>Ultimate Chicken Horse</i> and <i>Mario Party</i>.

                    <i>'We art the Hamster'</i> is an Interactive Comic that talks about the ideas of death and how we
                    as people think about death. The ideas that come from this project come from the book
                    <i>'Biocentrism'</i> by Robert Lanza. In this book he talks about how we as people and as
                    generations of people share very similar experiences, and are in a way, more connected to each other
                    than we think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The comic takes place in an elementary school in which the class pet hamster dies. The professor and
                    the kids have a talk about what it means to die and what happens after life. This topic was a very
                    hard idea to tackle, since we as humans are going to never know what it is like after death, but we
                    can make good guesses about what it may be like.

                    My title in this experience was as Team Lead. I helped to manage ideas between each member of the
                    team, and help in both the art side of the project, and the coding of the game side. I helped to
                    keep the members of the team feel like their voice was heard, keep ideas flowing during the early
                    stages of the project, and to give us a clear direction for the project's success.

                    <i>'Dusk Till' Dawn'</i> is a VR Horror Experience that takes you into the boots of an
                    unfortunate person stuck in the dead of night alone with their thoughts. The player must survive the
                    night and use light sources wisely, or their insanity will get the best of them.

                    This game is my Senior Year Showcase game for when I graduate from BSU next year. Currently the game
                    is a work-in-progress, but I am making constant changes to the game as development continues.
                    Progress will be posted on my LinkedIn page and on GitHub.
